            <h2>Today's Highlights</h2>
            <p>
                The convergence of AI and automation reaches a pivotal moment as 2026 unfolds. Tesla's zero-intervention coast-to-coast drive and Neuralink's production-ready brain interfaces signal that autonomous systems are moving from experimental to operational. Meanwhile, the developer landscape undergoes radical transformation—non-technical builders ship production code through AI agents, consuming billions of tokens without reading a single line. The question is no longer whether AI will reshape industries, but rather who has the better AI: the attackers or defenders, the builders or the incumbents. As reasoning models dominate releases across major labs and agentic platforms proliferate, we're witnessing the infrastructure layer of the AI-native era taking shape—from biometric proof of personhood to atmospheric computing architectures that reimagine how cloud services interconnect.

Their Model 3 completed the drive in 2 days and 20 hours, starting at the Tesla Diner in Los Angeles, CA, and ending in Myrtle Beach, SC. It was accomplished with Tesla FSD V14.2 on AI4 hardware. The milestone trip was widely lauded by members of the Tesla community.

The company also launched clinical trials in the Middle East and the UK, and completed two surgeries in Canada. It upgraded its surgical robot to be able to insert an electrode thread every 1.5 seconds at insertion depths of over 50mm. Neuralink plans to move to an almost completely automated surgical procedure this year.

                    Ben Tossell, who works at Factory, a company developing a frontier software development agent, has spent 3 billion tokens in four months through an agent without writing any code. None of the code was read, but Tossell read the agent output religiously, which led to him picking up a ton of knowledge around how code works, how projects work, where things fail, and where they succeed. Tossell has shipped several projects using his method over the past few months, including a personal site, a 'wrapped' product for Factory, several custom CLIs, and an AI-directed video demo system.

                    The primary security question for companies will be how good their attackers' AI is versus their own AI. There will be increased spending on agentic security platforms and significantly more in-house building of security tools. Asset management will become possible for the first time because of agents. Most security platforms will eventually be replaceable with AI prompts.
