            <h2>Today's Highlights</h2>
            <p>The technology landscape is witnessing a profound shift from theoretical AI capabilities to real-world deployment at scale. Today's digest reveals three converging narratives: autonomous systems moving from lab to highway, the democratization of technical building through AI agents, and the industry's collective gaze toward an accelerating future.</p>
            
            <p>Tesla's coast-to-coast zero-intervention journey and Neuralink's production ramp-up signal that 2026 marks the transition from proof-of-concept to mass deployment. Meanwhile, non-technical builders are shipping production code using AI agents, fundamentally challenging our assumptions about who can build software. These aren't isolated developments—they're symptoms of an underlying acceleration that experts predict will only intensify as next-generation hardware comes online.</p>
            
            <p>The common thread? We're entering an era where the question isn't whether AI will transform industries, but how quickly organizations can adapt their security, hiring, and operational models to an agent-first world.</p>

None of the code was read, but Tossell read the agent output religiously, which led to him picking up a ton of knowledge around how code works, how projects work, where things fail, and where they succeed. Tossell has shipped several projects using his method over the past few months, including a personal site, a 'wrapped' product for Factory, several custom CLIs, and an AI-directed video demo system.</div>
