Human-in-the-loop design ensures precise control at every stage.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n* **Academic Research**: Paper surveys, benchmark reviews, literature analysis\n* **Technical Research**: Technology comparison, framework evaluation, tool selection\n* **Market Research**: Competitor analysis, industry trends, product comparison\n* **Due Diligence**: Company research, investment analysis, risk assessment\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code\n\n```\n# English version #* ~ # Chinese version #* ~# Required: Install agent # ~# Required: Install Python dependency #\n```\n\n### OpenCode (default: gpt-5.2)\n\n```\n# Skills (same as Claude Code) #* ~# or research-zh for Chinese ## Required: Install agent # ~# Required: Install Python dependency #\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n> **Claude Code 2.1.0+**: Direct `/skill-name` trigger is now supported!\n>\n> **Older versions**: Use `run /skill-name` format instead.\n\n| Command (2.1.0+) | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `/research` | Generate research outline with items and fields |\n| `/research-add-items` | Add more research items to existing outline |\n| `/research-add-fields` | Add more field definitions to existing outline |\n| `/research-deep` | Deep research each item with parallel agents |\n| `/research-report` | Generate markdown report from JSON results |\n\n## Workflow & Example\n\n> **Example**: Researching \"AI Agent Demo 2025\"\n\n### Phase 1: Generate Outline\n\n```\n/research AI Agent Demo 2025 \n```\n\n💡 **What will happen**: Tell it your topic → It creates a research list for you\n\n**You get**: A list of 17 AI Agents to research (ChatGPT Agent, Claude Computer Use, Cursor, etc.) + what info to collect for each\n\n### (Optional) Not satisfied? Add more\n\n```\n/research-add-items /research-add-fields \n```\n\n💡 **What will happen**: Add more research items or field definitions\n\n### Phase 2: Deep Research\n\n```\n/research-deep \n```\n\n💡 **What will happen**: AI automatically searches the web for each item, one by one\n\n**You get**: Detailed info for each Agent (company, release date, pricing, tech specs, reviews...)\n\n### Phase 3: Generate Report\n\n```\n/research-report \n```\n\n💡 **What will happen**: All data → One organized report\n\n**You get**: `report.md` - A complete markdown report with table of contents, ready to read or share\n\n## Need Help?\n\nIf you have questions, ask Claude Code to explain this project:\n\n```\nHelp me understand this project: https://github.com/Weizhena/deep-research-skills \n```\n\n* RhinoInsight: Improving Deep Research through Control Mechanisms for Model Behavior and Context\n\n## About\n\nStructured deep research skill for Claude Code with human-in-the-loop control\n\n### Topics\n\n[research](/topics/research \"Topic: research\")   [opencode](/topics/opencode \"Topic: opencode\")   [llm-agent](/topics/llm-agent \"Topic: llm-agent\")   [claude-code](/topics/claude-code \"Topic: claude-code\")   [deep-research-agent](/topics/deep-research-agent \"Topic: deep-research-agent\")   [claude-code-skills](/topics/claude-code-skills \"Topic: claude-code-skills\")   [gpt-skills](/topics/gpt-skills \"Topic: gpt-skills\")   [opencode-skills](/topics/opencode-skills \"Topic: opencode-skills\")\n\n### Resources\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.
