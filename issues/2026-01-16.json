Il focus si concentra sul divario tra aziende che adottano l'AI e quelle che non lo fanno, e su come iniziare da un problema reale piuttosto che da una tecnologia. Un messaggio chiave è che il costo di non provare l'AI è maggiore rispetto al costo di adottarla.","source":"youtube::Raffaele Gaito"}],"articles":[{"title":"A headline from 1986.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1qdu56k/a_headline_from_1986/","summary":"A Reddit post sharing a 1986 headline image from the r/singularity subreddit.","source":"reddit:singularity","relevance":7,"reason":"The post presents a historical headline from a documented year (1986), which qualifies as factual news content.
