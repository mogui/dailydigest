The thesis felt important enough to verify. So I dug through SEC filings, earnings reports, and technical benchmarks. What I found: NVIDIA isn't dying. It's $35.1B quarterly revenue is up 94%. Yes, market share dropped (90% → 70-80%), but the pie is growing faster. Groq and Cerebras have impressive chips, but asterisks everywhere. The real moat: 4 million devs can't just abandon 20 years of CUDA tooling. Plot twist: the biggest threat is Google/Amazon/Microsoft, not startups.","source":"reddit:singularity","relevance":9,"reason":"The post presents factual financial data (SEC filings, earnings reports) and technical analysis (market share, chip comparisons) to challenge a claim about NVIDIA's viability.
