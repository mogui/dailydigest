A few weeks ago I shared how I'm building a system to capture workshop diagnostics and surface them when they're useful. Some assumptions didn't survive. This is the next thing that broke. TL;DR: Hierarchical structures work well for authoritative storage, but fail when users enter through multiple, symptom-driven paths. Conflating storage and discovery creates false negatives even when the knowledge exists. What seemed to work: The system captures diagnostic history properly now. Paper job cards → structured data → searchable knowledge. It filters for signal, not noise. For isolated problems, it works. Alternator failure, brake pad wear, coolant leak — symptoms map cleanly to single components. Where it fell apart: The moment I tried to diagnose anything involving multiple systems cooperating, the structure failed. Real example: No heat from vents. Customer complaint: No heat. I search the HVAC folder for heater core issues, blend door faults, A/C compressor problems. The answer exists in the system: heater hose leak at quick-connect fittings. But it's filed under Cooling System, not HVAC. I never find it. Same fault, three diagnostic paths: No cabin heat → tech searches HVAC folder → not found. Engine overheating → tech searches Engine folder → not found. Coolant loss → tech searches Cooling folder → found ✓. Success rate: 33%. The knowledge exists. Two-thirds of the entry points fail. The structural problem: Hierarchical storage forces every piece of knowledge to have a single 'correct' home — even when the problem spans multiple systems. Author decides where it lives based on what the component is (heater hoses = cooling system component). But diagnostics doesn't work that way. You search based on what's broken (no heat = HVAC symptom). The mental models don't align. Worse: Multi-system components. Some components affect five systems simultaneously. Multi-function camera: Filed under ADAS. Causes ABS warning lights. Tech searches brake systems, finds nothing. A significant portion of diagnostic knowledge involves multi-system components. Hierarchy makes them invisible from most entry points. Why duplication doesn't work: First instinct: file heater hoses in both Cooling AND HVAC folders. This creates: Content drift and maintenance overhead (update one, forget the other). False pattern separation (system thinks the same fault is different problems). The insight: The problem isn't search. The problem is conflating where knowledge lives with how it's found. Storage needs: One canonical location (prevents duplication). Clear ownership (prevents drift). Hierarchical structure (author's mental model). Retrieval needs: Multiple entry points (symptom, system, feature). Non-linear navigation (not forced through one path). User's diagnostic path (not author's filing decision). These are different problems. Trying to solve both with one structure fails. What I'm testing: Separate the two concerns: Storage layer: Hierarchical. Heater hoses live in Cooling System folder. One location, one source of truth. Retrieval layer: Secondary indexing. Knowledge items get indexed by the systems they affect, symptoms they cause, and features they interact with. The indexes don't replace hierarchy — they reference it. Hierarchy stays canonical; indexes are just entry points. Search 'no heat' → queries indexes → finds heater hoses (even though they're filed under Cooling). Navigate Cooling folder → finds heater hoses via hierarchy. Same knowledge. Multiple discovery paths. Zero duplication. Early results: Testing with multi-system components: Retrieval went from unreliable to consistently fast. Duplicate creation dropped to zero. Authoring cost increased slightly but predictably. The knowledge doesn't move. The indexes do. Why this might matter: If you're building knowledge systems for domains where: One thing affects multiple systems (diagnostics, troubleshooting, incident response). Users don't know the root cause yet (that's what they're diagnosing). Entry points vary (symptom, error code, affected feature). Hierarchical storage probably fails the same way. Not because hierarchies are bad, but because they solve the wrong problem. Storage and retrieval are different. Conflating them creates false negatives. Still testing. But the pattern seems real.","source":"reddit::softwarearchitecture","relevance":9,"reason":"The post presents a technical analysis of a system's hierarchical structure problem, providing specific examples, a solution, and test results.
